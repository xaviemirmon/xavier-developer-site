I’m originally from Northern California, just a short drive from Silicon Valley, where I first developed a passion for technology and innovation. Now based in Brighton, UK, I bring over a decade of experience in web design, development, and strategy, with a focus on delivering cutting-edge solutions that simplify the digital landscape. Growing up surrounded by the fast-paced world of tech, I’ve always been fascinated by how technology can drive both creativity and efficiency.

In my current role at Veeva, I’m part of the Link Workflow product team, where I turn product ideas into tangible features for the pharma industry. I quickly ramped up, making my first commit within three days. Since then, I’ve focused on delivering high-quality features, including advanced report filtering, a multicell paste feature (using React-DND), and an app refresh mechanism. Beyond feature development, I’ve improved internal libraries, addressed technical debt, and debugged production issues. I also led the upgrade from React 18 to React 19, ensuring platform stability and long-term maintainability.

Before Veeva, I led the new product initiative at IDX in building decoupled, low-code platforms using technologies such as Drupal, React, Next.js, Puck, and TypeScript. My experience spans everything from greenfield product development to large-scale digital transformation projects for globally recognised brands. At IDX, I played a key role in developing a new design system, revamping technical architectures, and fostering collaboration between design and development teams. These efforts significantly improved site performance, reduced technical debt, and enhanced platform governance.

Prior to IDX, I served as Technical Director at Coherence Digital, where I led cross-functional teams to develop low-code page-building tools and digital strategies for large web estates. I’ve consulted for top-tier clients like Stanley Black & Decker, Bayer, and Close Brothers Merchant Bank, helping them streamline their digital ecosystems and improve efficiency across hundreds of sites. My focus on low-code solutions accelerated product development and improved the scalability of client platforms, particularly with Acquia Site Studio.

Throughout my career, I’ve embraced new challenges—integrating emerging technologies, refining processes to eliminate bottlenecks, and implementing efficient cloud hosting solutions to reduce costs. I thrive on finding innovative ways to leverage technology for business growth and user engagement, and I’m always keen to mentor and lead teams toward greater collaboration and technical excellence.

Outside of work, I’m a dedicated home cook, an avid musician, and a lover of the outdoors. When I’m not working on a web project, you can find me experimenting in the kitchen, enjoying Brighton’s vibrant craft beer scene, or renovating my Victorian home. I also love spending time on the South Downs, where I go for walks and runs with my dog. Music remains a big part of my life as well—I play the double bass, DJ, and occasionally present on the radio.

I’m passionate about both the technical and creative aspects of life, and I’m always looking for new ways to blend the two in my work. Whether developing a web platform, mentoring a team, or building my next project, I’m driven by the belief that technology should make life simpler and more accessible for everyone.
