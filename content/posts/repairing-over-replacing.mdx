We live in a world of instant gratification.  Thanks to services merchants like Amazon and Temu we can have virtually anything we can think of at bargain prices often times within a few hours. While Prime same-day shipping is a distribution marvel, we're becoming increasingly disconnected between our goods and how they are manufactured.  Have a broken phone? Order a new one. A leaky tap? Order a new one. A worn-out sweater? Buy a new one. It's easy to fall into the "replace, don't repair" trap, but is it truly the best choice?

Over the past few years I've become more aware of the impacts this.  With simple changes and repairs to we increase the longevity of the items we purchase.  With resources such as YouTube, it's easier than ever to find videos that help with repairs.  There are so many tutorials for the same or similar models to most household gadgets.  A few of my go to channels are:

Using the techniques that I've learnt from those videos I've managed to carry out the following repairs over the past few years:

1. iPhone — battery replacement
2. Echo speaker alarm — re-soldered faulty power jack
3. Robot hover — cleaned an replaced faulty battery
4. Washing machine — Replaced condenser dryer solenoid 
5. Car wing mirror — replaced mirror
6. Kids bike — 3d printed fork gasket
7. Panini press — added a new cord
8. Nintendo Wii — removed DS game and fixed the faulty drive mechanism
9. Watch — battery replacement
10. Stand mixer — Replaced gears
11. Handheld mixer — Replaced gears
12. PSP — replaced broken screen with OLED and swapped case
13. iPod mini — battery replacement
14. Sonicare Toothbrush  — created new battery packs by spot welding AA batteries
15. Kärcher patio head — had grit or sand stuck in one of the nozzles

Out of all of these repairs, most were simple fixes mainly issues with needing new batteries or a quick re-solder.  It may seem daunting at first but after getting into a lot of different gadgets they are actually a lot simpler than they might seem on the face of it. My main advice is to **never work on anything plugged in** be careful around power and capacitors.

To get started a good are here are a few essential and super useful tools!

- a [toolkit](https://www.ifixit.com/en-gb/products/mako-driver-kit-64-precision-bits)
- a [soldering iron](https://vector3d.shop/products/pinecil-smart-mini-portable-soldering-iron-version-2?variant=49398742188370&country=GB&currency=GBP ) 
- a [multimeter](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AstroAI-Digital-Multimeter-Measurement-Electronic/dp/B01ISAMUA6/) 

I've really enjoyed this journey of learning more about electronics and repair (not to mention the money saved by not buying replacements).  If you have something broken around the house why not attempt fixing it first!
